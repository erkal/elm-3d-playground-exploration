{-| Create an angle that cycles from 0 to 360 degrees over time.

Here is an [`animation`](#animation) with a spinning triangle:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
        animation view

    view time =
        [ triangle orange 50
            |> rotate (spin 8 time)
        ]

It will do a full rotation once every eight seconds. Try changing the `8` to
a `2` to make it do a full rotation every two seconds. It moves a lot faster!

-}
spin : Float -> Time -> Float
spin period time =
    360 * toFrac period time


{-| Smoothly wave between two numbers.

Here is an [`animation`](#animation) with a circle that resizes:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
        animation view

    view time =
        [ circle lightBlue (wave 50 90 7 time)
        ]

The radius of the circle will cycles between 50 and 90 every seven seconds.
It kind of looks like it is breathing.

-}
wave : Float -> Float -> Float -> Time -> Float
wave lo hi period time =
    lo + (hi - lo) * (1 + cos (turns (toFrac period time))) / 2


{-| Zig zag between two numbers.

Here is an [`animation`](#animation) with a rectangle that tips back and forth:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
        animation view

    view time =
        [ rectangle lightGreen 20 100
            |> rotate (zigzag -20 20 4 time)
        ]

It gets rotated by an angle. The angle cycles from -20 degrees to 20 degrees
every four seconds.

-}
zigzag : Float -> Float -> Float -> Time -> Float
zigzag lo hi period time =
    lo + (hi - lo) * abs (2 * toFrac period time - 1)


toFrac : Float -> Time -> Float
toFrac period time =
    (time - toFloat (floor (time / period)) * period)
        / period
