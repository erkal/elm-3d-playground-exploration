elm-watch recompiles whenever your Elm files change and reloads the compiled JS in the browser.

Note that elm-watch is all about Elm. Not HTML, not CSS, not JavaScript, not TypeScript and not serving files or proxying requests. That’s a strength in my opinion, but also something to be aware of. You can’t just replace for example Parcel with elm-watch and expect everything to be taken care of.
